「Insanely Simple: The obsession that drives apple's success」 是由肯·西格尔（Ken Segall）所著，这本书从他的视角讲述了苹果公司的简单哲学如何成为其成功的核心驱动力。肯·西格尔是一位前广告行业的执行人员，曾经在苹果公司的广告代理机构工作过多年，并参与了包括“Think Different”在内的多个著名广告活动和苹果产品的品牌推广。

但值得注意的是
1. 西格尔的论点很大程度上基于他个人在苹果公司的经历和观察。尽管这些经历非常宝贵，但它们仍然是主观的并可能反映了他个人的偏差。
2. 他将苹果的成功过分归功于对简单性的追求，在某些情况下有些过于牵强。
3. 时间的局限性：成文于2012 年，近十年苹果的发展可能不能完全归功于对 simplicity（简单性）的追求。

然而，文中对乔布斯工作的细节的描述、以及作者对做事方式的若干总结，对我仍有较大的启发性。

# Take-Aways
> Steve had rejected their work - not because it was bad, but because in some way it failed to distill the idea to its essence. It took a turn when it should have traveled a straight line.

事情的背景是包装设计团队为一个产品设计了两个包装。


> Blunt is Simplicity. Meandering is Complexity.

直白地表述，跟字节的“坦诚清晰”原则是一样，对立面是说话绕弯子。

> He ran his business as if there were precious little time to waste, which well reflected the reality for Apple—as surely it does for any company serious about competing.

做事情应该有的态度。

> For Steve Jobs, that T-shirt wasn’t nearly tough enough. His standards simply weren’t negotiable. Though it can make people uncomfortable, or make them say unflattering things behind your back, you can’t let yourself be talked into going along with something when you know it can be better.

乔布斯的严格是出了名的，后面会多次提到：不妥协。对应字节的“追求极致”。

> Simplicity’s Best Friend: Small Groups of Smart People. What Lorrie experienced was the strict enforcement of one of Simplicity’s most important rules: Start with small groups of smart people—and keep them small. Every time the body count goes higher, you’re simply inviting Complexity to take a seat at the table. 1.Throw out the least necessary person at the table. 2. Walk out of this meeting if it lasts more than 30 minutes. 3. Do something productive today to make up for the time you spent here.

小而精的团队能快速移动，快速纠偏。此段的背景是一个不必要的人出现在会议上，被迅速清出去了。

> This is part of the challenge that we non-Steves must face. Most of us aren’t comfortable with the idea of turning into coldhearted control freaks, but we also know that we sometimes need to be tough to keep projects on track.
True.

> The quality of work resulting from a project increases in direct proportion to the degree of involvement by the ultimate decision maker.
Also True.

> The quality of work resulting from a project is inversely proportional to the number of people involved in the project.

> “I don’t want someone guessing what I’m going to like or not like,” Steve explained on more than one occasion. “Maybe I’ll see a spark in there that nobody else sees.” 
亲临一线捕捉所有细节。


> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things we have done. Innovation is saying no to a thousand things.

抛弃傻点子是更难的，每天都有很多点子出现，必须在筛选点子的过程里精益求精。对一个问题出现的第一个点子往往是错的，起码是不完备的。

> Intel’s approach seemed based on the premise that a single bad idea would bring down the empire. Apple’s approach embraced the idea that it’s okay to make a mistake, that it’s better to shoot for the stars and fall short on occasion than to burden itself with processes that drain the creativity from its ads.

> And it was pretty convincing proof: The more things you ask people to focus on, the fewer they’ll remember. Lee’s argument was that if we want to give people a good reason to check out an iMac, we should pick the most compelling feature and present it in the most compelling way.

> To achieve great things, two things are needed; a plan, and not quite enough time.

> Target-wise Apple needed to reach three different groups of people. First were those who remembered the great Apple of old but whose opinions of the brand had faded along with Apple’s success. Second was the new generation of users who were young enough that they’d only known one Apple—the anemic one.

客群的定位，对中台团队也很重要。

> Apple wasn’t for everybody; it was for those who valued creative thinking.

> And so we wanted to find a way to communicate this. And what we have is something that I am very moved by. It honors those people who have changed the world. Some of them are living; some of them are not. But the ones that aren’t, as you’ll see—you know that if they ever used a computer, it would have been an Apple.

广告的管用讨论，与目标形象构建关联。


> It was “As long as you’ve got new ideas to share, you are free to re-present the old one.” 

背景是iMac命名第一次被否了，但他们没放弃，后面又借机提了一次，但必须有其他点子做陪衬。

> There was no slide show, no leave-behind, no formalized strategy. It was just a conversation. Sometimes the product was in the room with us, sometimes not. Steve would just share his point of view about why the product existed, how it worked and what set it apart. When necessary, he’d jump to the whiteboard to illustrate his point. In effect, Steve acted as his own slide show. There was no more efficient way to hear about the philosophy behind a product than to hear it from the CEO himself.

想法是聊出来的。

> What Steve didn’t need at that point was a formal presentation. In effect, he was saying, “Please stop being ad agency guys and just talk to me.” Simplicity is in a hurry. It wants to cut to the chase and concentrate on the important stuff. No insult to you and all the time you’ve spent preparing that convincing speech, but much of what you’re about to say is likely superfluous. Many people incorrectly assume that by increasing the word count they will demonstrate their smarts, when the opposite is almost always closer to reality. Those who know how to communicate with brevity are the ones who come across as smarter and are more appreciated by executives who value their time. To Steve, the meeting we started to have was something that happens when big companies deal with big agencies. The setup part came across as a form of manipulation. He wanted to judge our ideas on their merits, not on our opinion of how he should react. The more formal the presentation, the more suspicious Steve seemed to get. There’s a thin line between leading clients to a conclusion and treating them like idiots. There was probably a bit of that in Steve’s reaction to “being led” as well. The best approach with Steve was to just lay the facts on the table and start the discussion. That was the time to express your opinion and push for the conclusion you believed in. In many ways, a formal presentation creates a barrier. Just because it ends with “Any questions?” does not mean it promotes conversation. At the end of the day, most businesses come down to relationships. A less formal pre-sentation with honest debate is the way to strengthen your relationships—and get better results. The informality of Steve’s conference room style was based on the fact that he considered most meetings to be brainstorming sessions. Even if you brought finished work to the meeting to share, it would be discussed and dissected before you left the room. The only time Steve believed in making a formal presentation was when he was onstage unveiling a new Apple product. Apple’s launch events were painstakingly choreographed and rehearsed to the nanosecond. There was a backup plan for everything that might possibly go wrong. But even in an onstage production so perfectly planned, the informal Steve could easily be seen. If you were to look at a slide show that accompanied one of Steve’s onstage presentations without Steve’s persona to walk you through it, you’d be surprised how utterly simple it is. It’s straightforward to a fault. Absolutely, Steve’s purpose was to steer the audience toward the conclusion he wished, but he did so in the most direct way. In fact, in many ways he followed the traditional presentation playbook: Lay out the agenda, lay out the facts for each topic, then summarize each topic before moving on to the next. At the end of the show, he’d summarize the high points of the entire show all over again. If he had a thought he wanted to stick with you, he’d repeat it. Over and over. Steve was relentless about rehearsing and tweaking his big product unveilings for days and weeks, to make sure the world saw what he wanted it to see. In that sense, these events were formal. However, Steve wasn’t a polished presenter in the traditional sense. He didn’t stand erect, speak slowly, and enunciate like he’d just come from presentation class. He spoke more like a passionate twenty-year-old with the wisdom of a fifty-year-old. What made people relate to him was that despite all the rehearsing (and to some degree, because of it), he still came across more like the guy in the conference room than the CEO onstage.

这段比较长，但我还是摘下来了：能激发谈论的是事实， 而不是展示包装后结果后面跟一句：Any Questions?

> The informality of Steve’s conference room style was based on the fact that he considered most meetings to be brainstorming sessions.

> Well, maniacal tyranny is in the eye of the beholder. No one denies that Steve was incredibly demanding, relentlessly tough, and, in certain moments of passion, outright scary. His bottom line was that the ship had to be moving forward every day. If you weren’t helping, that’s when you got in trouble.


> That last qualification is one that Steve Jobs used to talk about all the way back at NeXT. He made it a point to say that in the technology business, the only truly meaningful change is a 10x improvement over what came before.

马斯克也说过。


> It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.

> Apple isn’t interested in ideas that try to please everyone. Those are the ideas that end up stripped of their character, feeling calculated and worst of all—less human.


> It’s made me wary whenever I hear the word “no.” For the sake of Simplicity, it’s a good idea to probe thoroughly when you run into a negative response. It might just be that you’re asking someone to go above and beyond what’s normal—but that’s how you get above-normal results. If there are rules, chances are they can be broken. If you let someone off the hook, it’s your idea that will be diminished in the end.

If there are rules, chances are they can be broken. 不找借口，先想办法，也是我比较看重的，只是 push 的没那么强。（但这里已经跟 simplicity 没啥关系了）


> The Apple designers recognized that when the vendor said, “It can’t be done,” what he really meant was that it couldn’t be done without extraordinary effort.

世上无难事。

> Windows users streaming into the Apple camp. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he told Apple’s employees that they had to change their thinking. In another great moment for Simplicity, Steve summed it up by saying, “We have to get it out of our heads that for us to win, Microsoft has to lose.” He went on to say, “The battle for the desktop is over. And we lost.”

一个反面思考的案例。苹果要赢的微软必须输，但按常识思考，微软不太能输。

> However, what you can do is normally quite enough. You can make sure that when you move your ideas forward, you leave nothing to chance. This means erring on the side of overkill. By not restraining yourself, by using only the most potent weapons in your arsenal, you’ll give your ideas the greatest chance of survival. Think of it as a war (because it is) and move ahead with all the grace of a military commander—by using overwhelming force.

全力以赴。 Use Overwhelming Force. Use every available weapon.

> Every new plan and every new idea needs to break through a layer of resistance. That layer could be the naysayers who don’t wish to change the status quo, those who believe it can’t be done, or those who simply don’t have the level of commitment required to expend the effort.

> When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can oftentimes arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. 

很骄傲的讲我按这个路线做成过事。

> Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.

> Don’t allow the discouragement of others to force compromise upon your ideas. Push. If you can’t get satisfaction with one person or vendor, move to another. If there was one area in which Steve Jobs had a well-deserved reputation for being impossible, this was it. He was relentless about executing ideas and demanding that people perform.
